These are the course files for [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers). This is an online course offered by Johns Hopkins University. It teaches the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JS, along with an introduction to Bootstrap and Ajax. This course was very interesting and inspired me to continue improving my web development skills.

I finished this course on December 28, 2020.
